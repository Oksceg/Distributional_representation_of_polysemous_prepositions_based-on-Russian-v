# Distributional representation of polysemous prepositions (based on Russian v)
In many languages, including Russian, prepositions are considered to be the most frequent ambiguous function words. Their distributional representation and disambiguation of senses is of great importance for NLP tasks that concern semantic role labeling, paraphrasing, answering questions and other. Although there are no works on distributional representation of polysemous prepositions in Russian, it is possible to start working with that due to the variety of machine learning approaches, linguistic tools, language models and also English works that are related to the tasks of Preposition and Word Sense Disambiguation. This work provides the experiments on distinguishing senses of a Russian polysemous preposition v ‘в’. This project involved the creation of a small dataset containing 100 examples, where it is possible for a native speaker to define different meanings of v, the vectorisation of the data and its clustering. The difficulties consisted in the selection of suitable ways of vector representations and picking the best possible clustering algorithms. The work shows that this objective is not trivial, yet it is possible to proceed to it.
